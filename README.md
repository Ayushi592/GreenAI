# Green Skills and Artificial Intelligence Integration Workshop 🌱🤖

This repository contains the work completed during the **Green Skills and Artificial Intelligence Integration Workshop**, aimed at promoting sustainability through innovative AI solutions.

## 🌍 Workshop Objective

The primary goal of this workshop was to explore how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be leveraged to address sustainability challenges. Through hands-on sessions, participants learned to integrate green skills with AI technologies to develop practical, impactful solutions for a better planet.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python** – Core programming language for model development and data handling.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation and numerical computation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** – For building predictive AI models.
- **Specific Datasets** – Related to environmental metrics, sustainability indicators, or energy usage.

## 💡 Project Contribution

During the workshop, I contributed to the development of:
- A **sustainability tracker** using Python that analyzes environmental data.
- **Data visualizations** to identify trends in sustainability efforts.
- A basic **machine learning model** to predict sustainability-related outcomes based on historical data.
